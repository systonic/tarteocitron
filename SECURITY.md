## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please disclose responsibly by [report it here](https://www.systonic.fr/signaler-une-vulnerabilite).

We will assess the issue as soon as possible on a best-effort basis and will give you an estimate for when we have a fix and release available for an eventual public disclosure.

We do not have a bug bounty program.
